 <h2 style="color: #888;font-style: none; text-decoration: none; font-size: 40px; font-weight: 200; font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;"> My work focuses on the idea of escapism through the lens of musical expression and how there is a duality that exists within all art forms in which we simultaneously escape and adhere to societal constructs. My interest in escapism was initially fueled by observing the dynamics between our daily lives and the media in pre-COVID America. In order to cope with the contemporary intense political climate and the many complex, multifaceted global issues that we had limited control over, many Americans tended to engage in escapist behaviours. There was a prominent separation between global issues and global perspectives that was catalyzed by the media we consumed. The arts in many ways are capable of serving as a way to momentarily experience a different world that was less corrupted by social inequality and corporate greed. The consumption of media created by artists can sometimes serve as a form of delusion. Thereâ€™s a very human tendency to paint the world through a lens that omits certain ideas and perspectives, making the stories we tell more cohesive and digestible but also sacrificing a sense of realism. Traditionally, art, especially music, is perceived as a tool to evade our sense of reality and defy the pervasive constructs that dominate humanity both on a personal and global level; that it is capable of transcending our limitations. Throughout different historical periods, art is reactionary to forces that affect society. It can be characterized as a weapon and a form of protest. However, art is limited by the world we have experienced and therefore maintains our attachment to the world we attempt to escape from. Ultimately, through art we convey that we are only human. While the idea of escapism appears on a surface level to establish a dismal perspective towards the arts, it is a reflection of how despite being influenced by experiences we are fundamentally more than those experiences because we eventually are able to recreate society.
